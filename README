You'll need to configure a database to store your data in and a user
that can log in and write to that database. For best results your
database should be configured to use UTF-8 character encoding.

Then edit lemon.conf and set the database connection parameters,
username and password.

Run script/lemon_server.pl to test the application. On the first
request the database tables will be created automatically. Then
navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to configure your first user
and get started.
